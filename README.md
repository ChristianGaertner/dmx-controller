# dmx-controller

This project aims to provide a unique approach to controlling dmx fixtures.
Its main purpose is to suite the needs and requirements of clubs or bars which want to have sophisticated visual lighting effects
while not having a dedicated LD during opening hours.

In contrast to typical DMX software, it uses a server-client architecture, with the server being responsible for calculating effects
and sending DMX output, while the client software is soley instructing the server what to do. This allows operaters to use any computer
they like for controlling which cues to play, while not compromising on performance.

This is not intented to replace established DMX software and DMX consoles, it provides an alternative for a group of people who
are not yet satisfied with the current landscape of DMX software.
